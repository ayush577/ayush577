### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ayush Gandhi
Hi, I'm Ayush Gandhi â€”a M.E.A.N stack developer & product designer at upwork

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on uicrumbs, [Threatspy](http://secureblink.com/), thesharplook
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning node.js, deno, typesrcipt

## How I work ðŸ˜„
My motivations are to stabilize and provide clarity through curiosity. That tends to manifest as creating (hopefully) just enough process. Checklists are my absolute favorite. âœ… If I'm too much in my head, feel free to nudge me to share what's in my brain. ðŸ˜¸
