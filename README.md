### Hi there 👋, I'm Ayush Gandhi
Hi, I'm Ayush Gandhi —a M.E.A.N stack developer & product designer at upwork

- 🔭 I’m currently working on uicrumbs, [Threatspy](http://secureblink.com/), thesharplook
- 🌱 I’m currently learning node.js, deno, typesrcipt

## How I work 😄
My motivations are to stabilize and provide clarity through curiosity. That tends to manifest as creating (hopefully) just enough process. Checklists are my absolute favorite. ✅ If I'm too much in my head, feel free to nudge me to share what's in my brain. 😸
